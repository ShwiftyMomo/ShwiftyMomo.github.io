    <p>And most people would find that a quite
    obvious statement: Of cource calling art good
    or bad is subjective. But this leads me to a
    question: Is this piece of art good? It generates
    randomly what these words are, so it could be generating
    Shakspere to a beat. But most likely not.
    Do we judge each piece case by case or do we judge
    the code by it's potential?</p>
